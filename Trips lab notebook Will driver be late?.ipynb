    "Predict when the driver will arrive at the pick up location before the driver has started driving there. \n",
    "What factors are most predictive of lateness?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Framing the business case\n",
    "On-time arrival is an important metric for the business to optimize. 25% of customer negative comments after the trip mention the word \"late\" and another 19% mention time-related issues. \"Driver\" and \"Late\" are the top 2 most frequently used words in negative comments. The business would like to reduce lateness to improve customer satisfaction, improve retention, and reduce support costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are automated alerts in place when the driver is estimated to be late (based on current time, time of pickup, location of driver, location of pick up, predicted route and predicted traffic). By the time the driver is estimated to be late there may be too little time to correct the situation. The company incurs support costs working with the parties involved. It is not a good customer or driver experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce no-shows, the driver must check-in 60 to 90 minutes before the the scheduled start of the ride (otherwise the driver is replaced on that ride). The check-in period is an ideal time to alert the driver about the likelihood of arriving late to the pick up location. The driver is already interacting with the driver app at that time. Their attention is avaiable without separate messaging. The driver could take actions to reduce the chance of lateness, such as starting to commute on time. (is there an alert already when the driver has not starting on-the-way on time?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurate prediction is important. Reducing false alarms would tend to improve trust in this prediction and show respect the drivers time. Driver incentives could be added rides with high likelihood of being late to encourage on-time behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data considerations to address this use case\n",
    "We will ignore trips in training and test sets when we know the driver never arrived (in the data there is no arrival time). The on-time properly of these rides can not be directly assessed. These could be unclaimed rides or rides where the driver canceled or the organizer canceled before the driver arrived. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will predict on-time arrival on any trip which has not been canceled when the prediction is requested. Effectively, we assume the ride will not be canceled between the prediction time and the scheduled pick up. Predicting cancelation is a separate data science problem beyond the scope of this project. About 5% of remaining trips are cancelled within 90 minutes of the scheduled start. This discrepancy should have a small effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction model must only use data which is available at the prediction time. The following are those data items in this data set which may not have final values at prediction time: trip_state, canceled_by, canceled_at_pdt, canceled_before_scheduled_start, departs_for_trip_at_pdt, origin_arrived_at_pdt, origin_departed_at_pdt, destination_arrived_at_pdt, rating, trip_paid_time, events, has_cd_unclaimed_event, is_unfilled_canceled, is_cd_cancel, canceled_by_id, commute_miles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Labeling the data\n",
    "For supervised learning the training and testing data must be labeled. The labels are the target output of the prediction model. Our label will be the duration in seconds between when the driver arrives and the scheduled start. We can use the canceled rides which were canceled after the driver arrived. This adds about 2% in volume to the complete rides.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction target (label) arrived_seconds_after_scheduled_start will be <0 if arrived early, 0 if arrived exactly on time, >0 if arrived late. For trips where the driver never arrived, which ultimately get canceled, make the prediction target NaN. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "arrived_seconds_after_scheduled_start = \n",
    "    np.nan if np.isnat(origin_arrived_at_pdt)\n",
    "           else (origin_arrived_at_pdt - scheduled_starts_at_pdt).total_seconds()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to arrived_seconds_after_scheduled_start we will classify each trip to help interpret the results of the prediction in a business-friendly way. The classes are \n",
    "0. arrived on-time\n",
    "1. almost on-time (arrived up to 5 minutes after scheduled start)\n",
    "2. late (arrived 5 to 15 minutes after scheduled start)\n",
    "3. extremely late (arrived 15 minutes or more after scheduled start).\n",
    "\n",
    "LATER:\n",
    " * check-in time might be very informative. Could build a different model which uses check-in time when available.\n",
    " * could use prediction time itself compared to predicted on-the-way time, if we have that.\n",
    " * create transformed features such as time of day, day of week, distance from driver home to origin, duration claimed before scheduled start, compute duration from end of previously claimed trip to this trip, was drivers previous ride or recent rides late, unclaimed near scheduled time, claimed-scheduled.\n",
